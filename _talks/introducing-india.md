    I've recently returned from a 10 day trip to India, and what I'd like to do today is share that experience with you, and discuss some of the things I learnt along the way.

    My name is Tim Klapdor and I'm the cofounder of 26Fifty. We are a collective of creative technologists and designers and apply our skills to solving peoples problems. We currently have a number of clients as well as a couple of startup projects of our own.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-03.jpg

    One of those is Chickon where we are developing a computer vision tool that utilises Artificial Intelligence to get the live weight of a chicken. And not just one chicken, but 50,000... in real time. What we are developing is essentially precision agriculture in a livestock setting, and that through this data point we can create efficiencies across the whole supply chain.

    So the trip was part of the **Young Entrepreneur Bootcamp India** program that was facilitated by the Sydney School of Entrepreneurship and funded by the NSW Department of Industry. The program sent 30 early stage startups over to India to get a taste of the country and some of the potential it offers new startups.

    Wagga actually had a large contingent on the trip with myself, Jake Eaglesham from Rugby Matcher (a player matching service for clubs around the world) and Mackenzie Bond from Outback Wings (think Royal Flying Doctors but for Vets).
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-06.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    The aim of the program in India was to introduce us to their local startup ecosystem; introduce us to doing business in India; to gain knowledge through exposure to some of the opportunities and potential the India offers; and finally to learn about what's happening in India at this point in time.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-07.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    The trip was for 10 Days - so not that long, but they we did cram a huge amount into that time. We got to visit 4 Cities - Mumbai (where we spent most of our time), Pune, Ahmedabad and Bangalore. During our stay we interacted with around 40 businesses - including some of the biggest in India like Tata and JIO. We also were introduced to startups, incubators and accelerators in each of these places.

      So why India?
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-09.jpg
  slide-text: |-
      For starters India is the country with the second largest population, and by all estimations it will become the biggest within a decade. So there is a massive potential market in India, and when compared to Australia the opportunity based on that alone is huge.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-10.jpg
  slide-text: |-
      But despite that huge population Australia does very little trade with India. You can see here in the green is the population of China, India and New Zealand, and in the grey our trade. So despite the a population close to China we do just slightly more trade with India than we do with New Zealand.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-11.jpg
  slide-text: |-
      So India offers a massive untapped market, and on top of that a growing middle class.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-12.jpg
  slide-text: |-
      One of the beauties of working with India is that the two countries have a range of commonalities because of our shared colonial past. Yes there is a shared passion for cricket - this photo was take on a Saturday in a park in downtown Mumbai and I have never seen anything like it, there were literally hundreds of cricket games going on simultaneously within this pretty small space. But it's also important to note that India is also a democracy, the largest in the world. One of the other benefits is that we also share a similar legal structure. So if you're dealing with Intellectual Property and concepts like that, then India is a much friendlier place to do business when compared to say China.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-13.jpg
  slide-text: |-
      So why Australia? What is it that we can offer to the Indians?
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-14.jpg
  slide-text: |-
      The first is that we operate advanced industries. If it can be mechanised and automated then Australia will have done it, and done it at scale. Our industries are often running at peak efficiencies and with the most up to date technologies. So for companies in India we are an attractive partner and destination. Particularly if you want a test bed for the international market like Europe and the US.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-15.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    I'm not sure if everyone here is a aware of it, but Australians are a techincally mature population, we love our tech and are more than happy to embrace the next new thing. That's pretty unique around the world and so our status as early adopters is a selling point to anyone developing technology - Australians are your perfect first customers.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-16.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    Now when we were in India one of the speakers mentioned that one of the things Steve Jobs is famous for saying about the iPhone is "there's an app for that". In India they have something similar, it's that "there's a man for that". The fact that labour is cheap in India means that there approach to problems is more often than not to throw man power at it. In Australia it doesn't work like that, labour is often your biggest expense, so we tend to focus a lot more on developing our systems and processes and getting efficiencies that way. I think this is an important area of knowledge which we can trade with the India, because it fits their mindset of doing more with less.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-17.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    Finally I think one of the biggest selling points is the diversity of thinking in Australia. We are an incredibly multicultural society, but also one that doesn't hold much regard tradition. We're happy to challenge the status quo and the way things are done. It's not quite the same in India. They have long standing traditions which are embedded in their culture and the way things get done. Australia can offer an alternative to that way of doing things.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-18.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    So, why India and why now? Well India is undergoing a massive transformation at the moment. Socially and economically India is changing and it's at a point where the opportunity costs are lower than they have every been. When I searched for an image for India Transformed I came across this series of images, this is one of the ubiquitous rickshaws you see in every Indian city given the transformer treatment, and I think it's a really great metaphor because there really is "more that meets the eye" in India at the moment.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-19.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    The biggest change going in India is to do with it's population. Not necessarily it's size, but it the massive changes in it's demography. At the moment the are 600 million Indians under the age of 25. That's not just significant, it's mind-blowing. It makes India's population one of the youngest on the planet, but also one of the biggest.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-20.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    And with that you have 600 million people eager to get an education and get a job in the next few years. The Indian Government knows this, and they also know that currently they just dont have the education system or the jobs for those people coming onto the market. So they are investing heavily in those spaces, and are putting a lot of money into into just expanding current industry, but in developing brand new ones. There is massive investment in startups and technology because they have the potential to grow globally and make India a new centre for growth in the world.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-21.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    One of the other big changes has been the uptake of digital technology in India and their movement towards becoming a truly digital population. And I want to talk about that change and what it means by talking about two big factors in that change - Jio and money.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-22.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    We got to visit the Jio campus outside Mumbai during our trip and it was a great day out. For those of you unfamiliar, Jio is a telecommunications company - so think Telstra or Optus. Now Jio is relatively new to the market. They came into being during the rollout of 4G technology - so they didn't have any legacy equipment or infrastructure, they came into the market fresh and with a single driving idea.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-23.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    To have the lowest data costs in the world. Now for anyone with a Telstra or Optus plan here you might want to look away...
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-24.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    But what that means is 1Gig of data per day for $3 a month. Jio realised early on that the real benefit of 4G wasn't better phone calls, it was data. And that everything was shifting to becoming a data driven application, including voice and video calls.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-25.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    So their data plan was a pretty aggressive entrance into the market, but the other component of this wasn't just the data, but the device. India's population, particularly in its regional areas is poor. Offering a $2000 iPhone is not going to work in that market, but if you could get a device into the hands of millions of people you can change everything. And so the Jio Phone was born. Now it may look like an old Nokia, but this is a fully fledged smart phone. It has dual cameras, so can take photos and do video chat. You can install apps, watch streaming video, listen to music - everything you can do on a more expensive device. And it costs $50 to make. With that Jio entered the market.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-26.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    And when they did, they made a splash. Now that is not a typo - they signed up **100 million** users in just 170 days. That's almost unfathomable to most Australian's, especially when it comes to the IT systems required to support that many people. The biggest we've got was the Online Census and we know how much of a debacle that was!
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-27.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    So that's led to a massive transformation in technology adoption across India - so out of the 1.3 billion people they now have 900 million of them with a mobile device. All capable of getting online and consumign and sharing their data.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-28.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    A lot of you would have heard this phrase before, that data is the new oil. And for a lot of people that equates to that idea of Black Gold, Texas Tea - of getting rich off the back of oil. But Jio understood that data isn't the new oil in that sense...
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-29.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    ... it's because everything runs off it. That by providing the infrastructure that allows data to be accessed and utilised they have become a vital player in Indian society.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-30.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    Now the interesting thing is, once you have that infrastructure in place - the majority of the country on a device and with a data connection - you can start to rethink how you do things. And money is one of those things.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-31.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    A few years ago the Indian Government invested in moving from a physical cash based society to a digital one. There are some significant reasons for doing this - to clean up organised crime and also to cut down on corruption. You see, in a cash based society it's quite easy for people to skim a few bills off every transaction. So when it came to a lot of government payments, the money just wasn't reaching who it was supposed to address because everyone along the chain was taking a cut. But with a digital payment you can give it directly to the person who needs it.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-32.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    The government invested in India's Immediate Payment Service, and the reason for this was to allow mircotransactions to occur. For us here in Australia, our digital infrastructure is paid for. Mastercard, Visa and the Banks - they all take a cut of every transaction that goes through that system, and they make a lot of money. In India where you have so many transactions that are quite small, cents in order to pay for food and drinks, taking a cut or paying a fee wasn't viable. So the government developed their own standard for transactions which essentially made them free.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-33.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    So in India today you can walk through any market or shop or taxi and pay with your phone. So that idea of backwardness that we may have about India is totally wrong. What's happened over the last 5 years means that as a country they are digitally ready and connected.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-34.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    So some of the lessons I took away from the trip. The first was to really start thinking much bigger about my ideas and startup. Coming from the regions I think my focus has always been quite local, but India really opened up my mind to what's possible and what's out there when we think globally.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-35.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    Which means that you don't have to have everything right here. That it's possible to separate different functions of your business to completely different geographic areas, but remain connected. For me, I could see the huge potential for partnering with Indian companies and sharing our different expertise.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-36.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    One of the interesting things to see was how digital platforms allow people to connect around the world. That by using platforms like Kickstarter, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, you can find customers around the world.  
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-37.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    This was bought home when we saw this - a robotic chess board. A really niche product but these Uni students designed and developed in India for themselves - they liked chess and the physicality of the board but they wanted to play games remotely or with a computer opponent. They stuck their idea up on Kickstarter and within a couple of hours had fulfilled their funding request and had orders around the world. It showed that while you might have an idea that's quite niche, in a global you can make that a success.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-38.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    Another huge lesson was that India is a single place or people. That there was so much variety in the people, the regions and their cultures that you can't really think of India as one place - it's a multiverse. It's home to some of the biggest contradictions and clashes, but instead of being isolated they simply coexist.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-39.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    Nothing is probably more telling than the wealth disparity in the country. This is in Mumbai, the worlds most expensive house. It's worth something like $1-2 **Billion** dollars.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-40.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    But Mumbai is also home to Asia's biggest slum. If you've seen Slumdog Millionaire, that was filmed in the Mumbai slum. So you have these two contradictions coexisting in the same place and at the same time. Which means that India can be really segmented, but that there is a market for almost anything within that spectrum.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-41.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    But what this creates is an incredibly vibrant country. This is a photo I took in the slums and it was a really powerful moment because you have these contrasts right there in your face. These happy and amazing kids in a really depressed and deprived space. There's joy for life in India that you don't see as much here - and considering what we have seems quite strange.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-42.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    The last lesson is that doing business in India is different... kind of. And what I mean by that is that what is important over there isn't new or rocket science, but that it does have a big impact.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-43.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    The first area to concentrate on is price point. You have to get it right in India as there is just such a gulf in incomes. It doesn't mean that you have to be the cheapest, but you need to understand your market more and that they will be more price sensitive.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-44.jpg
  slide-text: |-
   Following along from price is the concept of value, it's something Indians are obssessed with. Value is a much more complicated concept than price because it draws upon culture and traditions. Even Indian companies get value wrong. Famously Tata bought out a car that cost $3500 and it flopped. The reason was because it made you look cheap because everyone knew that was a cheap car. What else could you get for $3500? Well a totally pimped out motorbike - something that lets you show off, lets you show your personality - and that is where the value lies.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-45.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    A good example of knowing your market and pursuing it is with Netflix in India. Rather than pursuing numbers in India and going for a cheaper price point, they are offering it as a prestige product - so their price is about the same as every other market at around $US10/month. The thing is, even at that price there's probably still more potential customers in India than in Australia!
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-46.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    The other bit of advice is that to go into India you're going to need a partner. Even Starbucks has partnered with Tata in India because you need someone local and on the ground who can help you navigate the legal and commercial landscape. Another important partner here is with the government. NSW Industry has a dedicated team here and in India to help you, and at the federal level AusTrade is there to help too.
- slide-image: 2019-introducing-india-47.jpg
  slide-text: |-
    So to wrap up. 1. India is full of opportunities - and they're more accessible than ever. 2. Plenty of potential to partner with India to exchange skills and ideas. 3. And finally - use the assistance that's on offer. You'll get the faster and with less mistakes! Thanks!
