one-liner: Develop new visual communication tools for make research accessible to the public.
description: |-
  The work undertaken with Fisheries in [Department of Primary Industries](https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fishing) was to investigate and develop prototypes for displaying and publishing information based on the research being undertaken. The problem was a communication issue - how do you take the data and results from research and make it accessible to the general public?

  I designed a "report card" PDF template that can be used to circulate information across the three main regions. I also developed and tested a number of technologies to create shareable and reusable resources across multiple publishing points. In the end we settled on developing using two main technologies - AMP stories and SVG graphics.

  The AMP stories allowed us to create more visually engaging 'stories' - a common feature used across social media - that allowed us to mix text and visual elements. AMP stories provided us with a platform agnostic way of creating them so that stories could be created once and shared across different social platforms.

  The SVG graphics allowed us to take data tables and visualise them, and again reuse them across publishing point. We also experimented with making them interactive and utilised the fact that you can embed both CSS and javascript into the SVG itself, reducing dependencies and creating a rich interactive.
status: Complete
outcome: |-
  The project was to explore what was possible and develop a number of protoypes that could be used and published to test user engagement. This ongoing work, and future development, is being handled internally within the Department. I learnt to use a number of new technologies and created a nice publishing workflow for the [AMP stories using Jekyll]().

  I hadn't realised how powerful and useful SVG graphics are! The project allowed me to explore what was possible with them and how they can be developed using existing software. I worked between Sketch and Atom to do the design work in one and then manipulate and code in the other. The time spent with AMP Stories was also interesting. It was the first time I used web components and while I can see their value - I do worry about their sustainability into the future. That said, for these kinds of projects it's useful and the way I developed them (using Jekyll) means that there is a plain text version that can be adapted into the future.
