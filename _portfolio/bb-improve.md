one-liner: Developing a new Blackboard theme to enhance the learning experience.
description: |-
  Blackboard Improve was a year long project who's aim was to overhaul the student experience in the Learning Management System (in this case Blackboard). The LMS is a key technology that all students studying at CSU have to engage with - regardless of if they are studying online or on campus. It provides a central point of communication and distribution of relevant learning materials and activities. That said the LMS is an external system (vendor owned and managed) and had very little changed from the default. The gulf between students experience in our internal systems and websites and the LMS had grown immeasurably and the LMS was looking quite sad and old. It also lacked key features like responsive design making it mostly incompatible with mobile devices.

  The first iteration of the project was to look at how could we "hack" the system to improve the look and feel for some high profile courses. This was done by injecting CSS inline into the page which was effective but unsustainable and scalable. We petitioned to get permission to move these changes into the main theme, so that they would be available to all and improve the default styles of content in all courses.

  I undertook all of the development work as well as engaging with relevant stakeholders and helped create the **Learning Materials** style guide which we incorporated into the main theme. The other large component of the project, and the most difficult, was to restyle the whole Blackboard interface, from top to bottom. This would bring it into line with CSUs other online systems and greatly improve the user interface.

  As well as the overall design I also wrote all CSS and support documentation, developed the style guide site, was the main point of call for troubleshooting and communication.

  Complete.
outcome: |-
  My CSS abilities increased about 100x by the end of the project. Blackboard is due for an entire redesign and when you peek under the hood you know why. A couple of decades of code build up, inconsistencies, feature additions means that it is heaving with technical debt. Rather than being able to address that debt, which may have in the end been easier, I could only change the visual components on the screen via CSS. It required a ninja-like approach in some cases because of poor markup or design within Blackboard. The timelines were also quite tight and rather than rolling out in a staged way the decision was made to launch at the beginning of the year and the busiest teaching period. Communication were not affective as staff were away over the Christmas and New Year break and there was a definitive crunch when it went live at the start of session.

  That said after the initial hiccups the new theme performed really well and the student response was overwhelmingly positive. Even the academics that had reacted to the new theme could understand the reasons for the change and the methodology that was undertaken.

  The theme is still in place and is such a huge improvement it would be difficult to go back to anything like the default now.

  This was one of those projects where things went wrong. The scope of the project was large - it affected every single student and all teaching staff - but it wasn't resourced accordingly. This is because of internal structures within the university and the fact that Product Owners aren't necessarily in control of the resources to actually manage the product itself. For example the main pool of staff with web development experience are in the web team - who's remit is the website and admin systems, not learning and teaching systems. So a lot of responsibility went onto my shoulders as well as most of the labour required to complete the project. At the same time many decisions that directly affected the project were not in my control and so I was beholden to changes to timelines, timeframes and rollout dates that were beyond my control. We had limited ability to test effectively given the scale of the system and we weren't able to stagger rollout, it was all or nothing.

  What I got out of the project was a clear understanding around decision making, resource allocation, staff burnout (my own) and the need for more diverse communications strategies.
