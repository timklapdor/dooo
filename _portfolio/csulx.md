one-liner: A pattern-based approach to learning design.
description: |-
  The Online Learning Exchange was developed at Charles Sturt University as part of the roll out of the [Online Learning Model](% link _portfolio/olm.md %). The aim was to develop a support tool that allowed both academics and learning designers to create a shared repository of practice to aid the implementation of the elements of the Model. I helped to develop a [pattern language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language) for this project having come across the concept used in other disciplines.

  >A pattern language is a method of describing good design practices or patterns of useful organization within a field of expertise. The term was coined by architect Christopher Alexander and popularized by his 1977 book [A Pattern Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language).

  Starting with the Model we had our seven elements - Learning Communities, Interaction Between Students, Teacher Presence, Interaction with the Professions, Flexible & Adaptive Learning, Interactive Resources & E-Assessment. We then developed *strategies*, individual components that academics could implement into their existing courses or build new ones with similar to lego bricks. The strategies provided the right granularity to be pieced together, which allowed each course to be custom designed and bespoke to match the desired experience, discipline and level. Each strategy includes a practice example to that demonstrates how it's being used and to show variations in the pattern itself.

  Along with the strategies we developed the Mixer. The model and the exchange were never about setting prescriptive requirements, but rather to enable different designs to flourish while being linked to a broader model of practice. The mixer set out to illustrate this by showing that rather than engage all elements to their full extent, each element could be implemented on a sliding scale of intensity. This would allow academics to create a 'mix' suited to their course and then work out what kind of strategies they would implement.

  Complete.
outcome: |-
  The site itself hasn't changed a lot since its inception but it has become a tool used by staff within the university, but also has found a larger global audience. The sites design was kept simple with the idea that it could be syndicated or federated across multiple institutions.

  I really liked the concept of a pattern language the first time I read about it and was glad to have a chance to create my own. That said it's incredibly difficult to get the right level of granularity and to explain that to others. We're so used to thinking big picture when it comes to learning design and teaching, but quite often it is the small elements that make the bigger difference. Getting down to those components takes a bit of work and trying to decouple one strategy from another can be difficult.

  I'm really happy with the level of exposure the Learning Exchange has gotten over the years and it's an impressive resource that I'm really proud of.
