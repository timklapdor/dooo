slug:
one-liner: A model for learning online that increases student engagement
description: |-
  The CSU Online Learning Model (OLM) was developed as part of a strategic project to develop a direction for online learning design and development across CSU's broad portfolio of disciplines. The aim of the project was develop a model that was varied to ensure that it was fit for purpose, but also provided a consistent approach to the overall learning experience for students.

  The OLM built on Moore's (1989) model that which incorporates *learner-teacher*, *learner-learner* and *learner-content* interaction. The model broadens Moore’s notion of interactivity to one of **engagement** and adds *learner-community* as well as *learner-institution* engagement to ensure a well rounded and connected student experience. The model is informed by a wealth of educational research and best practice examples from across the sector.

  The main tenants of the model were 7 discrete elements of quality online learning:

  1. Learning Communities
  2. Interaction Between Students
  3. Teacher Presence
  4. Interaction with the Professions
  5. Flexible & Adaptive Learning
  6. Interactive Resources
  7. E-Assessment

  The model has gone through multiple iterations and been tested in a range of pilot programs before being rolled out across the institution and embedded into learning design practice.
status: |-
  Complete.
outcome: |-
  The model was workshopped across the university and for the first time provide a consistent language that could be used by both learning designers and academics to co-design and develop their courses. After the workshops we ran pilots across the faculties and refined the model further. This was then rolled out on a limited basis and tested before becoming mainstreamed in 2018.

responsibilities:
- Design and Development - Used a design-thinking approach to develop and refine the model.
- Workshops - Helped design and facilitate workshops with academic staff across all of the campuses at CSU.
- Visual Design - developed the iconography used in V1 and V2 of the model. Created the handouts, flyers, presentations and other resources used in the models promotion and roll out.

  The development of the model was driven by a strategic need to create a more cohesive learning experience, and that ensured the model had some authority from the outset. The way that we ran the workshops and pilots meant that academic and learning design staff had a sense that they were co-creating it with us rather than it being forced onto them. This approach enhanced the effectiveness of it's implementation.
