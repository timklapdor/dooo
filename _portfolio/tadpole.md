one-liner: The Adaptive Digital Publishing Engine
description: |-
  Tadpole was a prototype of a system for publishing content from a single source to multiple formats and destinations. The work came about as a result of the mLearn project and investigations into publishing learning materials in mobile friendly formats. Tadpole took on the idea "metamorphosis" for publishing content, or adaption through *specialisation*, rather than translation or transcription, to convert content from one format to another. We wanted to create a way to Create Once and Publish Everywhere across different file types and purposes. For us this meant PDF for print, HTML for online and ePub for mobile and offline digital uses.

  Existing systems can transform text  between HTML, PDF and ePub without an issue - but all fail when it comes to media elements. What do you do with a video in a PDF? How do you present a spreadsheet on a mobile?

  Our solution was the development of an Adaptive Media Element (AME) - a meta-object which contains referential information about a media object. For example an AME might contain a file type reference, links to various local versions of the file itself (say images in different resolutions), a weblink to an external source or library (YouTube or Flickr), source information of where it came from, reference information, alternative files or metadata, a title, a caption and a description. Tadpole would then use this information during the publishing phase to adapt the media to fit the output format. So that video would be an embedded YouTube clip in the HTML, an image with a link to the online version in the PDF and an included file within the ePub so it's available offline.

  We built a prototype of Tadpole using Wordpress and a fork of Pressbooks. We created a plugin to manage the AME library and had system publishing the correct output as HTML. That was the extent of the proof of concept we developed, the final files that were produced were manually handled from that point, but would be automated in the finished product. Unfortunately the funding for the project ended and I couldn't secure additional funds or timelines for further development.
status: Dormant - I don't want to say it's finished or dead because I've yet to see this idea realised. I'm hoping I can come back to it in a while. After working with Jekyll I think I could replicate the functionality with a Static Site Generator.
outcome: We produced a range of files for the proof of concept as well as a short paper explaining the concept. I applied for Shuttleworth Foundation funding (which was unsuccessful) but I did make a good video for the application which explains Tadpole pretty well.
