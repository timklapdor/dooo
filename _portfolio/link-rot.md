title: Link Rot
slug:
one-liner:  A podcast about whats happening in life, technology and the way they intersect and interact
description: |-
  Link Rot was an experiment to work out what it took to setup and run a podcast. The format was essentially just three guys having a chat about a couple of chose topics. The aim was to go for something lightweight and that required a minimal amount of editing. It have us the opportunity to test different equipment and web technologies to host. I ended up building a tool in Jekyll to run the website, RSS feed and show notes.

  Recording wise we started off recording in a studio at CSU but found that the overhead of it was a bit much. We ended up recording most episodes on a RÃ˜DE Stereo VideoMic connected to my iPhone as we sat around a table - and while the sound quality isn't amazing, it was a nice guerrilla middle ground.
status: Complete - the podcast is now living up to it's name - hanging around as link rot :-)
outcome: |-
  We have a fully functional podcast! You can access it via a variety of podcasting tools - and while I need to go and make some updates for Spotify and other players, it all works rather well.

I learnt a lot about podcasting from this process and I wrote up [a complete guide](http://linkrot.net/podcast.html) to the whole thing - which has spawned a few other podcasts to copy parts of the process and hence grown the number of podcasts out there! I got a lot out of this project - mainly a way of defining what I'd want in a podcasting setup. I am hoping that we might resurrect the podcast at some point - just for a couple of episodes periodically.
