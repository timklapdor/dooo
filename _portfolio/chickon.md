one-liner: Vision based precision agriculture tool for poultry.
description: |-
  Chickon uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to massively increase the sample size and provide real time data. Chickon allows farmers and producers to make informed decisions throughout production and the entire supply chain based on more reliable and accurate data.

  The project kicked off as the winning idea at the 2018 Agrihack event in Wagga Wagga. The challenge was to find a solution to get the live weight of a chicken. The weight is ***the*** key measurement as it indicates the health of the animal, the growth rate and helps determine the growing conditions - feed, water and temperature. Weight is also used throughout the supply chain and is used to determine when birds are processed, transported, distributed and what is sold to customers.

  Our solution was to use a vision based system to develop an AI that would be able to determine the weight of a chicken in real time. Not just one chicken, but a shed of 50,000. In real time. This kind of data would feed into decisions around the animals health as well as improve efficiencies across the whole supply chain.  

  We were able to take Chickon to India as part of the NSW Government's Young Entrepreneur Boot Camp and learn a lot about the startup eco-system in India as well as the potential opportunities to collaborate with Indian businesses.
status: |-
  **Hiatus** - Chickon requires seed funding for it's initial machine learning phase and we are yet to find a source.
outcome: |-
  Chickon hasn't progressed beyond the idea stage but we have developed a comprehensive research and development model outlining our strategy for phased development. We have some developed a proprietary method for developing our machine learning model and refining our AI which we seek to develop which would allow us to scale across environments and industry sectors.
