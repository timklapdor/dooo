one-liner: Exploring the potential of mobile technology for teaching and learning.
description: |-
  mLearn was my biggest project to date. It was two years long, multithreaded and combined new innovations and technology with a practice based approach. The aim of the project was to explore the potential of mobile technology for teaching and learning in a variety of different circumstances and approaches. We ran a huge range of device trials using iPads, created the first API driven application in the university, tested content delivery and publishing methods, and created a resource to address the needs of staff and students. The team and I worked across all of these aspects, published a number of papers and presentations, wrote an extremely detailed report with recommendation and contributed practical knowledge back to the institution.

  During the period of the project we accomplished a lot! Each one of our trials provided a myriad of benefits to the staff and students involved and with each one conducted over the two years, we gained a deeper insight into the versatility and possible applications of mobile devices. Our Subject Outlines for mobile devices provided students with data from multiple systems and provided a simple way to interact with one of the key documents during their study at CSU. Our work with getting existing content to work on mobile devices led to us developing [Tadpole](% link _portfolio/tadpole.md %). We created the mHub to collate information about mobile learning and the various applications available and tested during the trials. The small cross discipline team was able to achieve a huge amount in a short amount of time and showed the benefits of working in an agile way.

  This was the first project which I led at the university. I had worked on a number of projects and lead a team before, but this time I was in charge so I made a few key changes to the projects I had worked on. Firstly, I employed a fulltime team rather than relying piecemeal support from internal resources. Secondly, I ditched the Prince2 methodology the university used and ran the project in an agile way. These two changes were at the heart of the success of the project.

  Success is also a subjective thing. We did a lot of fantastic work during mLearn and we were streaks ahead of most other universities when it came to what we had been able to achieve. We developed really strong and informed recommendation that would assist the university moving forward, and they were all completely ignored. You see the project was a teaching and learning project, not a technology one, so we couldn't tell our IT department what needed to change or what they should be doing. So thanks to politics and egos all the work we'd done went no where, so rather than be at the cutting edge the university did nothing and 5 years later lagged significantly behind. That was a pretty hard lesson to swallow - watching all that work being ignored.

  I did walk away from that experience though a much better operator. I know what a small team can do when they can focus on the work at hand. I saw the direct benefits of working in an agile and iterative way (snowball not waterfall). I saw how much could be achieved working directly with academics and students rather than at an arms length. I also learnt the importance of institutional politics. For what it's worth, I did receive a Vice Chancellor's Award for Leadership Excellence and mLearn really was the project that helped define my way of working.
