one-liner: 26fifty combines an “outside the box” approach with the latest technology to develop creative solutions to real world problems.
description: |-
  26fifty is the business created to house a range of creative projects being undertaken by myself, Ben Atkinson and Rob Stone. We needed an umbrella for a number of projects we were working across - including Kelpie and Chickon. We have also provided our services to the [NSW Department of Primary Industry]() and the [Wiradjuri Condoblin Corporation](https://wiradjuricc.com/) to develop creative new ideas and technology.
status: |-
  **On Going** - 26fifty is our side hustle, with the hope that one day it might become our main gig.
outcome: |-
  We now have the business infrastructure to work with Government and Corporate partners in developing and delivering technology projects.

  We set up the business in order to work with Government and Corporate entities and to simplify the process for applying for funding, invoicing and working on projects. It's given us the foundational infrastructure required to run a business and collectively spread the costs of doing so.
