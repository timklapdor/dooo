one-liner: A new identity for a community child care organisation.
description: |-
  A local community child care centre needed an update to their branding as new commercial operators were setting up in town. Community based child care is quite a different beast to the commercial operators, aiming to be more inclusive and child focused than a commercial service. Shaw Street has a long connection with my family - my daughter went there, my wife was president as was my aunt and all my cousins went there. We loved the place and so when they needed to update their look I donated some time to get them a new logo. But the existing brand and "logo" were a bit of a mess and made the place look less professional than it really was.

  I wanted to embed a number of key elements that really embedded the [philosophies of the centre](https://shawstreetchildrenscentre.org/about/philosophies/) - being inclusive and playful and the kids being special. The simple logo used some elements from the previous logo - namely the script type - but added the clean "star-ball" element to help provide a strong visual that the centre could use across multiple applications. These include staff uniforms, kids clothing and hats, signage, stationery and social media.  
status: Complete.
outcome: |-
  The logo was quickly adopted across the board - first appearing on uniforms and then deployed across the organisations materials. It created a more professional look to the centre than before which helped with promotion and created a rise in enrolments.
