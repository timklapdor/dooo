one-liner: The Digital Working Dog
description: |-
  Kelpie is a digital assistant for the next generation of farmer. Allowing data from right across the farm to be accessed in a simple to use interface, Kelpie empowers farmers to develop their own logic to create automated actions and connect different systems across the farm.

  Developed as part of the Australian Wool Innovations stream in the University of Adelaides eChallenge program Kelpie was the Runner Up in both the Tech eChallenge and eChallenge programs and went on to participate in the 2018 Hybrid World Lab for startups. This intensive bootcamp led to us being chosen as one of 6 finalists and the chance to pitch on stage at the Hybrid World Conference stage in front of 500 people. We  had a lot of practice in pitching to various sized audiences and developed a slick deck and presentation.

  We participated in the AgriTech Incubator at Charles Sturt University which helped develop a business proposal and helped to establish a brand, visual identity, website and marketing and we went on to develop a full app mockup and a simple prototype that demonstrated interactions using a functional API.
status: |-
  **Hiatus** - After our initial success at competitions, we weren't able to secure the necessary seed capital to help develop the app. We had a number of conversations with interested collaborators who were willing to help develop and open their technology to an API ecosystem to reduce data translation overheads, and there is keen interest with Farmers and a number of companies operating in this space.
outcome: |-
  We were able to quickly establish a recognisable and relatable brand throughout the AgTech space. We developed our concept to and developed a key understanding of the market and AgTech space. Our mockup and prototype received great feedback from users and we're confident that the idea is sound.

  The whole reason for Ben and I pursuing Kelpie was to get an insight into the world of startups â€“ how the system worked and what is needed to succeed. It was also an opportunity to get to know a whole other industry - Agriculture. The opportunities that Kelpie provided were invaluable learning experiences. We got to design, build, pitch, meet amazing people and travel around Australia as a result. While we didn't get it up and running, I think the idea is sound. One key lesson was to do with timing, as one of the assumptions we had was that there would be an API infrastructure that we could leverage. That's not the case in Agriculture. I believe that Kelpie could help promote and develop that infrastructure and act as an incentive, it requires something to build from. I think in the next 5 years that will happen, and when it does Kelpie becomes a much more viable business.
